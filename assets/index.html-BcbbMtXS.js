Tools like Warden, Borg at Google, Solaris Containers, and Cloud Foundry, leverage new concepts for application isolation.</p><p>Lastly, the groundbreaking introduction of usernamespace into the Linux kernel in 2013, marked the inception of Docker. This influential tool simplifies container creation and management based on Linux kernel functionalities.

It typically includes tools for building, testing, and deploying applications. PaaS offers a framework that simplifies the development process, enabling developers to focus on coding rather than managing hardware or software updates.</p><p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. It allows users to access and use software hosted in the cloud without needing to install or maintain it on their devices.
