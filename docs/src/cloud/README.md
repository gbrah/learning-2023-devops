## VMs (Compute Engine)

Compute Engine is Google Cloud's Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering that allows users to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud. It provides scalable and customizable VM instances, enabling users to run workloads, host applications, and perform various computing tasks in a cloud-based environment.

## Kubernetes Engine

Kubernetes Engine, also known as GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Google Cloud. It offers a platform for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes. GKE simplifies the orchestration of containerized workloads, facilitating the deployment of scalable and resilient applications.

## Container-based (Cloud Run)

Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform on Google Cloud that enables developers to run containerized applications. It abstracts away infrastructure management, allowing developers to deploy and autoscale containers without worrying about server management. Cloud Run supports both stateless HTTP-based services and event-driven workloads.

## Serverless

Google Cloud offers various serverless computing services, allowing developers to build and deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure. Services like Cloud Functions and Cloud Run enable developers to write and deploy code that responds to events or HTTP requests, providing a scalable and cost-efficient way to run applications.

This section introduces key offerings within Google Cloud (Gcloud), including VMs through Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine for managing containerized applications, the serverless nature of Cloud Run, and other serverless computing services available on the platform.
