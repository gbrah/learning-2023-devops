### What is DevOps ?

### A bit of History

The historical roots of cloud computing, traced its emergence back to the 1950s with the inception of mainframe computing and the subsequent development of ARPANET, a precursor to the internet.

Pivotal moments in cloud evolution, include the rise of virtualization in the 1990s, which transformed server utilization, and the introduction of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the mid-2000s, revolutionizing access to cloud services. It permit to enable key models such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that have shaped the cloud landscape.

Another main evolution enabled devops pratices is the evolution of computer containers, starting from their inception. The historical timeline, begin with early Unix days, emphasizing the importance of process isolation to maximize computing resources.

Important milestones such as chroot in 1979, which enabled application isolation, and subsequent advancements like FreeBSD Jails, OpenVZ, Linux-VServer, and the integration of namespaces and cgroups into the Linux kernel will be discussed.  Tools like Warden, Borg at Google, Solaris Containers, and Cloud Foundry, leverage new concepts for application isolation.

Lastly, the groundbreaking introduction of usernamespace into the Linux kernel in 2013, marked the inception of Docker. This influential tool simplifies container creation and management based on Linux kernel functionalities. Through these advancements, a new era in application deployment was ushered in, transforming the landscape of computing.

Join this course to understand and use softwares based on these historical milestones that shaped the creation and efficient management of cloud computing and computer containers, opening doors to innovative approaches in application deployment

### Architecture

- **On-Premises:** This refers to the traditional method of hosting and managing computing resources within an organization's physical location or data center. With on-premises infrastructure, all hardware, software, servers, networking equipment, and data storage are maintained and managed by the organization's IT staff.

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** IaaS is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers scalable and on-demand resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users can rent these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing for flexibility and cost-efficiency without having to manage the physical hardware.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** PaaS is a cloud computing service that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. It typically includes tools for building, testing, and deploying applications. PaaS offers a framework that simplifies the development process, enabling developers to focus on coding rather than managing hardware or software updates.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. It allows users to access and use software hosted in the cloud without needing to install or maintain it on their devices. Examples of SaaS include email services, customer relationship management (CRM) tools, and productivity software like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365.

These models represent different layers of cloud services, providing varying levels of abstraction from infrastructure to applications, catering to different needs and preferences of businesses and users.

## Exercise

To understand the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS and onpremise by analyze real-world 

Here is a list of application services :

|                           |                           |                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Google App Engine         | Atlassian Bitbucket Server| Oracle Cloud              |
| Jenkins                   | Red Hat OpenShift         | Microsoft Azure           |
| Dropbox                   | Alibaba Cloud             | AWS Elastic Beanstalk     |
| Cisco UCS (Unified Computing System) | Docker           | VMware vSphere       |
| IBM Cloud                 | Firebase                  | Salesforce                |
| OpenStack                 | Slack                     | Rackspace                 |
| GitLab                    | Microsoft Office 365      | Gmail                     |
| DigitalOcean              | AWS Elastic Beanstalk     | Microsoft Azure App Service|
| Zoom                      | Zendesk                   | HubSpot                   |
| Google Cloud Platform (GCP)| Microsoft Hyper-V       | AWS                        |
| Heroku                    | GitLab                    |                           |


Categorize each service or application they found into one of the three cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.
justify the categorizations. Why do they think a particular service fits into a specific model?
