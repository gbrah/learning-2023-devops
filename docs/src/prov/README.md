#  Provisionning

This section introduces Provisioning as a crucial step in setting up and configuring infrastructure for applications. It covers tools like Ansible and Terraform for infrastructure automation, Vagrant for creating development environments, and leveraging GitLab for automating provisioning tasks within CI/CD pipelines.

## Definition

Provisioning refers to the process of setting up and configuring infrastructure and resources needed for software applications to run. It involves tasks such as installing operating systems, configuring networks, and deploying applications.

## Ansible

Ansible is a configuration management and automation tool that simplifies the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure. It uses YAML-based playbooks to define and automate tasks such as application deployment, configuration, and system setup across multiple servers.

## Terraform

Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool used for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure. It allows for the definition of infrastructure in declarative configuration files, enabling the creation, modification, and versioning of resources across various cloud providers.

## Provisioning with Vagrant

Vagrant, while primarily used for creating and managing development environments, also provides built-in provisioning capabilities.
It supports multiple provisioners like Shell, Puppet, and Ansible, allowing developers to automate the setup and configuration of environments using scripts or configuration management tools.

## Provisioning with GitLab

GitLab provides Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) capabilities that can include provisioning tasks. By utilizing GitLab CI/CD pipelines, you can automate provisioning tasks, integrating Ansible or Terraform scripts to set up and configure infrastructure as part of the deployment process.
