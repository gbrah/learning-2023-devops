# Containerization 

## Definition

Containerization involves encapsulating applications and their dependencies into containers, allowing for efficient and consistent deployment across different environments. Containers package software in a portable, self-sufficient unit, ensuring isolation and enabling seamless deployment.

## Basic Usage

Containerization platforms like Docker provide tools to create, deploy, and manage containers. Users can build containers from images, run them as instances, manage their lifecycle, and interact with them using container-specific commands.

## Images

Images serve as blueprints for containers, containing everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. They are built from a Dockerfile, which specifies the configuration and steps to create the image.

## Registries

Registries store Docker images, acting as repositories where users can push, pull, and manage images. Docker Hub is a popular public registry, while private registries offer secure storage for proprietary or sensitive images within organizations.

## Multi-container with Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to configure services, allowing users to define multiple containers, their configurations, networks, and volumes in a single file.

This section covers the fundamental concepts of containerization, including its definition, basic usage with Docker commands, the role of images and registries, and the orchestration of multi-container applications using Docker Compose.
