# Containerization 

## Definition

Containerization involves encapsulating applications and their dependencies into containers, allowing for efficient and consistent deployment across different environments. Containers package software in a portable, self-sufficient unit, ensuring isolation and enabling seamless deployment.

Objectives : 
* Stop the ¬´¬†it works on my machine¬†¬ª syndrom
* Be the link between dev and ops

## An old history (70s)

### What is it?

* Software based on well known linux technologies
* Yet another layers between software and hardware
* Created to ease deployment of applications
* Starting point: cargo transport

### Containers‚Ä¶ for softwares ?

* As cargo container solved the problem of ethergenious transport mode, does software containers can solve

## The market 
* `LXC` (Linux Containers): Offers lightweight, operating-system-level virtualization, enabling multiple isolated Linux systems on a single host.
rkt (Rocket): Focuses on security and composability, providing a security-focused container runtime as an alternative to Docker.
* `Docker`: A widely used container platform enabling building, shipping, and running applications in containers, known for its user-friendly interface and comprehensive tooling.
* `Podman`: Docker alternative allowing container management without a daemon, offering a Docker-compatible command-line interface.
* `LXD` (Linux Containers Next): A container hypervisor with a REST API to manage system containers, aiming for a more user-friendly container management experience.
* `Linux-VServer`: Provides lightweight virtualization for partitioning a single server into isolated containers for security and resource control.
* `VMware vSphere Integrated Containers` (VIC)" for basic container deployment and management within VMware vSphere environments.

### What is a container ? 

## History 

### In the Dark ages : One application on One physical server


![virtu1](../assets/images/virtu_arch1.png)

* Slow deployment times
* Huge costs
* Wasted resources
* Difficult to scale
* Difficult to migrate
* Vendor lock in

### Then, virtualization : One server, multiple apps in VMs

![virtu2](../assets/images/virtu_arch2.png)

* Better resource pooling : One physical machine divided into multiple virtual machines
* Easier to scale
* VMs in the cloud 
    * Rapid elasticity
    * Pay as you go model

![virtu3](../assets/images/virtu_arch3.png)

### But VMs

* Each VMs stills requires
    * CPU allocation
    * Storage
    * RAM
    * An entire guest operating system

* The more VMs you run, the more resources you need
* Guest OS means wasted resources
* Application portability not guaranteed

### Containers

![dockerarch](../assets/images/dockerarch.png)


* Standardized packaging for software and dependencies
* Isolate apps from each other
* Share the same OS kernel
* Works with all major Linux and Windows distributions

### Benefits

* Speed : No OS to boot = applications online in a seconds
* Portability : less dependencies between process layers = ability to move between infrastructure
* Efficiency : less OS overhead
* Improved VM density

### Virtual Machines VS Containers ?

![vmvscontainer](../assets/images/vmvscontainer.png)

* Containers are an app level construct
* VMs are an infrastructure level construct to turn one machine into many servers 

### Mixed architecture

![mixed](../assets/images/mixed.png)

* Containers and VMs together provide a tremendous amount of flexibility for IT to optimally deploy and managed apps

### Statistics 

- Docker Hub hosts millions of container images, supported by a vast community.
- Billions of downloads and adoption by millions of developers and enterprises globally.
- Remains one of the most popular containerization platforms, pivotal in container technology adoption.

Throughout its evolution, Docker transformed from a niche tool to a fundamental technology, driving container adoption due to its user-friendliness, portability, and ecosystem growth.

### Inside docker 

Written in [GO](http://golang.org)
Unique tool upon:
* **LibContainer** (using LXC as plugin : Cgroup and Namespacing) providing :
    * **Filesystem isolation**: each process container runs in a completely separate root filesystem.
    * **Resource isolation**: system resources like cpu and memory can be allocated differently to each process container, using cgroups.
    * **Network isolation**: each process container runs in its own network namespace, with a virtual interface and IP address of its own.
* **Storage Backends** (devicemapper, AUFS, BTRFS, ‚Ä¶) providing :
   * **Layered file system**: root filesystems are created using ‚Äúcopy-on-write‚Äù, which makes deployment extremely fast, memory-cheap and disk-cheap.


### Images

A Docker image is a self-contained, immutable snapshot or template that includes an application's code, dependencies, and configuration, serving as the foundation to create and run containers.

### Registries

![registry](../assets/images/registry.png)

`Registries` store Docker **images**, acting as **repositories** where users can push, pull, and manage images. 
`Docker Hub` is a popular public registry, while private registries offer secure storage for proprietary or sensitive images within organizations.

###  Basic usage

Containerization platforms like Docker provide tools to create, deploy, and manage containers. Users can build containers from images, run them as instances, manage their lifecycle, and interact with them using container-specific commands.

- **Find ID of an Image:**
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
  *Output:*
  ```
  REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
  my_image      latest    abc123def456   2 weeks ago   500MB
  ```

- **Find ID of a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
  *Output:*
  ```
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND       CREATED       STATUS       PORTS     NAMES
  12345abcde     my_image   "/bin/bash"   3 days ago    Exited (0)             my_container
  ```

- **List Active Containers:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  *Output:*
  ```
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND       CREATED       STATUS       PORTS      NAMES
  abcdef123456   my_container  "/start.sh"   1 hour ago    Up 1 hour   80/tcp     web_server
  ```

- **List All Containers (Active and Inactive):**
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
  *Output:*
  ```
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND       CREATED        STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
  abcdef123456   my_container  "/start.sh"   1 hour ago     Up 1 hour  80/tcp      web_server
  12345abcde     my_image      "/bin/bash"   3 days ago     Exited (0)              my_container
  ```

- **List Images:**
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

- **Create a Container from an Image:**
  ```bash
  docker create [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
  ```

- **Remove a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker rm [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
  ```

- **Run a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]
  ```

- **Port Forwarding (Map Host Port to Container Port):**
  ```bash
  docker run -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT IMAGE_NAME
  ```

- **Remove an Image:**
  ```bash
  docker rmi [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...]
  ```

- **Pull an Image:**
  ```bash
  docker pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]
  ```

- **Execute a Command in a Running Container:**
  ```bash
  docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]
  ```

- **View Container Logs:**
  ```bash
  docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
  ```

- **Stop a Running Container:**
  ```bash
  docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
  ```

### Multi-container 

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to configure services, allowing users to define multiple containers, their configurations, networks, and volumes in a single file.

This section covers the fundamental concepts of containerization, including its definition, basic usage with Docker commands, the role of images and registries, and the orchestration of multi-container applications using Docker Compose.
