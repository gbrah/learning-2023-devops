# Micro-services
   
## Definition

Microservices is an architectural approach where software applications are developed as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is focused on specific business capabilities and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Architecture

Microservices architecture breaks down applications into small, autonomous services that communicate with each other through APIs. These services are typically organized around business domains, enabling flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance compared to monolithic architectures.

## API Gateways

API Gateways serve as the entry point for client requests in a microservices architecture. They manage and route incoming requests to the appropriate microservices, providing a single point of entry for clients and handling tasks such as authentication, authorization, and load balancing.

This section introduces the concept of Microservices, emphasizing their architectural approach based on decentralized, independent services. It highlights the advantages of this approach in terms of flexibility and scalability, along with the role of API Gateways in managing communication between microservices.
