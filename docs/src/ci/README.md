# CI/CD

## Definition

CI/CD, or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, is a software development practice that involves automating the integration of code changes, testing, and deployment processes. It aims to streamline and automate the delivery pipeline, ensuring rapid and reliable software delivery.

## CI/CD Platform (GitLab)

GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform that provides integrated CI/CD pipelines alongside version control, issue tracking, and more. It offers robust capabilities for automating software development processes, including building, testing, and deploying applications in a collaborative environment.

## CI/CD for Developers

CI/CD for developers encompasses several key stages:

### Build

The build stage involves compiling code, running automated builds, and generating artifacts or executable files from the source code.

### Measure

Metrics and analytics are collected during the CI/CD pipeline to measure the performance and quality of the software being developed.

### Test & Secure

Automated testing ensures that changes made to the codebase don't introduce bugs or issues. Security testing helps identify and address vulnerabilities in the code.

### Deploy

The deployment phase involves automating the process of releasing applications into production or staging environments.

### Monitor

Continuous monitoring post-deployment ensures that the application functions as expected and helps identify any performance or functional issues.

This section covers the concept of CI/CD, emphasizing its automation benefits and the role of GitLab as a comprehensive platform for implementing CI/CD pipelines. It also outlines the stages of CI/CD for developers, including building, measuring, testing, deploying, and monitoring software applications.
